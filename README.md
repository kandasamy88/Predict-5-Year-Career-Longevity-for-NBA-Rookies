# PART A
Data Visualization and Exploration 
Print 2 rows for sanity check to identify all the features present in the dataset and if the target matches with them. Print the description and Basic statistical details. 
Print each class label count  and create charts for each class (% of data distribution). 
Write your observation on data balancing. 
Discuss need and process followed for balanced class in dataset. 
Perform data exploration and discuss insights drawn from them. 
Data Pre-processing and cleaning Do the appropriate preprocessing steps Identify NULL or Missing Values based on column. 
Apply appropriate feature engineering techniques for them. Use normalization for feature transformation and justify the method selected. Do the correlational analysis on the dataset. 
Provide a visualization for the same. 
Data Preparation Do the final feature selection and extract them into Column X and the class label into Column into Y. 
Split the dataset into training and test sets. 
Case 1 : Train = 80 % Test = 20% [ x_train1,y_train1] = 80% ; [ x_test1,y_test1] = 20% ; 
Case 2 : Train = 10 % Test = 90% [ x_train2,y_train2] = 10% ; [ x_test2,y_test2] = 90% ; 
Case 3 : Train = 50 % Test = 50% [ x_train3,y_train3] = 50% ; [ x_test3,y_test3] = 50% ;
# PART B
Perform Model Development using Logistic Regression using gradient descent and MLE(maximum likelihood estimation). 
Compare and discuss results for both methods. 
Justify use of L1 or L2 loss functions for GD. Explore different GD methods if required.
Train the model and print the training accuracy, Recall, F1 Score for case 1, case2 separately.
Performance Evaluation Clarity of the problem statement and explanation/justification of each step. Do the prediction for the test data and display the results for the inference. 
Print test Accuracy, Recall, F1 Score for case 1, case 2 and case 3 separately. Print the confusion matrix for all cases. Compare the accuracy of train data with test data. 
Provide appropriate analysis for the same for all cases. Write your observation for result of each question and justify your answer.
